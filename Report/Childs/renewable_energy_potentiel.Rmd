## Comparison of the Share of Renewables and Fossil Fuels

```{r}
# Define renewable and fossil fuel categories
renewable_fuels <- c("Hydro", "Solar", "Wind", "Geothermal", "Biomass")
fossil_fuels <- c("Coal", "Gas", "Oil")

# Calculate total production by fuel type category

## Most Advanced Countries in the Energy Transition

## Power Plants with Production Below Their Capacity

```{r}

    underperforming = performance_gap > 0
  ) %>%
  filter(underperforming) %>%
  arrange(desc(performance_gap))

# View underperforming plants
print(head(underperforming_plants, 10))

# Visualization: Gap Between Capacity and Production
ggplot(head(underperforming_plants, 10), aes(x = reorder(name, -performance_gap), y = performance_gap, fill = primary_fuel)) +

It's an opportunity fore more renewable energy
